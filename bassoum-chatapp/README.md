#### this is my first ever chat application called BaSsOum
which stands for my nickname that came from my name Basma

in this app you will be able to add a new chat room and to invite your friends on it

you will be able to message them with photos and texts and change your avatar or you can delete anything you want to delete

####
in this app i used react as the framework 

and my favorite chat engine which facilitate for me the whole process 

with chat engine i was able to create-edit-remove anything i want

even the desing was made by this amazing template 

i just add some style to make as i wanted to

you will see in my project a lot of comment and explanation of everything i did

and you will find in each component the methods that i used and why
